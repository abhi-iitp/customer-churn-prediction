# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn in the telecom industry using Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier).  
The aim is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service and help businesses design retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Rows: 7043
- Columns: 21
- Target: Churn (Yes/No)

## 🔎 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with graphs  
3. Model Building (Random Forest + GridSearchCV)  
4. Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
5. Feature Importance Analysis  
6. Results & Insights  

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~82%  
- Key churn indicators: Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges  
- Senior citizens & customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn
